I am very new to github, so don't expect to have a lot right now. 
I am  doing a rework on some of the sabers, so most of them (all of them) are not there yet. 
Updates are not going to be out intel the saber comes out, 
Stadion may get a trail update or a lil better look on the saber it self.
Deadmans ballad is not done, so it may take a longest time.
Thread-Ripper is going to get a rework soon, trail is going to be less visable.
Illumination will be having a handle, and blur will be different.
Phantom are lost sabers that was my first made sabers with decryptedPov, so it will have a rework.
Cavement are going to have a saber rework (not the handle), the colors do not match it so well.
Unknowen saber called Icepop are going to be done and put on here.
Cxly sabers are having a bit of a better look and cleaner.
